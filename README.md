# ScuLabs

## Problem
With only 15 classes and rougly 20 TAs at Santa Clara University. It becomes a challenge for TAs to find another TA 
to cover their session. This system provides a solution to this problem. Rather than using Google Calendar 
(which requires every TA to use it and keep it updated) or SMS (blindly attempting to contact any TA) or Google sheets(
doesn't have any security on the page). Our solution, SCU Labs, will solve this problem, covering all the holes in the
current solutions addressed.

## Overview
The purpose of this project is to create a TA Contact System. 
TAs can create an account (which must be enabled by an admin), but can then enter a TA Portal.
In this portal, TAs can find other available TAs at a given lab time frame in order to contact them.

## How this addresses the problem
- Provides a simple, easy way to find TA contact information
- Managable as it generalizes to a weekly schedule - less work on TAs
- A web application and database can provide levels of security.
